2. **Writer Agent**: Takes the research findings and crafts them into a well-structured article

## Features

- Multi-agent collaboration using CrewAI
- Automated research and content generation
- Topic-based research capabilities
- Structured article writing
- Easy-to-use interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- CrewAI
- Additional dependencies (to be added as development progresses)
